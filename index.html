					<h2>Introduction</h2>
					<p>This case study highlights the development process behind my final project for IDM216: User Experience II. 
						Working with a team of five under the name The Blueprints, we took an existing Figma prototype from User Experience I and transformed it into a fully functional food delivery web app for the on-campus food truck, Kim’s Dragon. </p>

					<p>Our team included Amy Au, Hannah Desmond, Olivia Knestnaut, Vy Le, and Doyeon Yoo. Each of us brought different strengths to the project, making collaboration a key part of our success. </p>

					<p>As the primary project manager and tertiary data architect, I was responsible for leading the team, keeping the project on track, and contributing to the app’s data structure. 
						This project required us to move beyond design and dive into development, integrating both front-end and back-end components to create a working product. </p>

			<article id="challenge">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The goal was simple: take a static Figma prototype and turn it into a real, functional web application while staying true to UX best practices. </p>

					<p>We refined the original design along the way, ensuring it was as efficient and streamlined as possible. Our focus was on creating an intuitive ordering experience for students while developing a seamless front-end and back-end to support real-time functionality. To make sure the app met real user needs, we conducted multiple user tests and made necessary adjustments based on feedback. </p>
						
					<p>Simplicity was key. We wanted to minimize unnecessary steps while keeping the core functionality intact. Every decision was made with usability in mind, ensuring students could place orders quickly and without frustration. </p>

					<p>I played a dual role in this project, taking on both project management and data architecture responsibilities. </p>

					<p>As primary Project Manager, I kept the team aligned by setting milestones, tracking progress, and ensuring communication remained clear. Weekly meetings allowed us to check in, address concerns, and make decisions as a group. My goal was to provide structure without micromanaging, ensuring that everyone had what they needed to succeed. </p>

					<p>Beyond managing the workflow, I also contributed as a tertiary Data Architect, ensuring that our files and assets were well-organized and properly maintained throughout development. I established a clear naming convention, ensured that team members uploaded files in the correct formats and locations, and maintained version control to prevent confusion. By keeping our structure clean and accessible, I helped streamline collaboration between design and development, reducing time spent searching for assets and preventing misplaced or outdated files from disrupting our workflow. </p>

				<h2>My Roles</h2>
				<p>I played a dual role in this project, serving as both the primary project manager and a tertiary data architect, while also contributing to user research and testing. My responsibilities spanned from team coordination, workflow management, file organization, and user testing, all of which contributed to shaping the final product. </p>

				<h3>Project Management</h3>
				<p>As the primary project manager, I focused on keeping the team aligned, tracking progress, and ensuring clear communication. Weekly meetings allowed us to check in, discuss concerns, and make key decisions as a group. One of the biggest lessons I learned was knowing when to step in and when to step back. Initially, I thought project management meant overseeing every step, but I quickly realized that trusting my team’s expertise was more effective. Instead of micromanaging, I facilitated discussions, created structure, and only intervened when necessary. </p>

				<p>We used Microsoft Teams as our main communication tool for quick updates and task tracking. Keeping an open space for team members to voice concerns helped keep everything on track without unnecessary intervention. My role was to ensure progress while allowing the team the space to execute their work effectively. </p>

				<h3>Data Architecture</h3>
				<p>Beyond project management, I also played a role in organizing and maintaining the project’s structure as a tertiary data architect. With multiple design and development files being shared across the team, maintaining organization and version control was critical to preventing confusion and keeping the workflow efficient. I established a clear file-naming system, ensured files were properly uploaded and accessible, and maintained version control so that the team always worked with the most updated versions. </p>

				<p>These details, while small, played a major role in streamlining collaboration and reducing the time spent searching for assets or resolving miscommunication. Keeping documentation up to date also prevented last-minute scrambling and ensured a smooth workflow from design to development. </p>

				<h3>UX Research &#38; User Testing</h3>
				<p>While user testing wasn’t originally part of my role, I took the initiative to organize testing sessions and track how real users interacted with the app. Since I was already overseeing project progress, it made sense to ensure our final product was truly optimized for students. Through testing, we identified friction points and areas that slowed down the ordering process. </p>

				<p>We simplified the checkout flow, adjusted button placements, and ensured clear navigation based on user feedback. These refinements helped shape a final product that was intuitive, functional, and free of unnecessary obstacles. Prioritizing user feedback throughout the process reinforced the importance of testing and iteration in creating a seamless experience. </p>

					<h2>Conclusion</h2>
					<p>Taking a Figma prototype and turning it into a fully functional app was a challenge, but seeing how our work improved the user experience made it rewarding. We didn’t just build what we were given. We iterated, refined, and streamlined the design to make sure it was efficient and easy to use. </p>

					<p>Stepping into a project manager role for the first time was a major learning experience. Balancing leadership, communication, and technical contributions gave me a new appreciation for what it takes to manage a UX-driven development process.</p>
						
					<p>This project wasn’t just about building an app. It was about making smart, user-centered decisions while working with a team to bring a vision to life. </p>
