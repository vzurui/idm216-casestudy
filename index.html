					<h2>Introduction</h2>
					<p>This case study highlights the development process behind my final project for IDM216: User Experience II. 
						Working with a team of five, we took an existing Figma prototype from User Experience I and transformed it into a fully functional food delivery web app for the on-campus food truck, Kim’s Dragon. </p>

					<p>Our team included Amy Au, Hannah Desmond, Olivia Knestnaut, Vy Le, and Doyeon Yoo. Each of us brought different strengths to the project, making collaboration a key part of our success. </p>

					<p>As the primary project manager and tertiary data architect, I was responsible for leading the team, keeping the project on track, and contributing to the app’s data structure. 
						This project required us to move beyond design and dive into development, integrating both front-end and back-end components to create a working product. </p>

					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The goal was simple: take a static Figma prototype and turn it into a real, functional web application while staying true to UX best practices. </p>

					<p>Throughout the process, we refined the original design to ensure efficiency and simplicity while focusing on a seamless ordering experience for students. A major challenge was developing a functional and responsive front-end and back-end system that supported real-time ordering. To guarantee that the app met user expectations, we conducted multiple rounds of testing and made refinements based on direct user feedback. </p>
						
					<p>We aimed to reduce unnecessary steps and keep core functionalities intact, ensuring that students could place orders quickly and without friction. </p>

				<h2>My Roles</h2>
				<p>I played a dual role in this project, serving as both the primary project manager and a tertiary data architect, while also contributing to user research and testing. My responsibilities spanned from team coordination, workflow management, file organization, and user testing, all of which contributed to shaping the final product. </p>

				<h3>Project Management</h3>
				<p>As the primary project manager, I focused on keeping the team aligned, tracking progress, and ensuring clear communication. Weekly meetings allowed us to check in, discuss concerns, and make key decisions as a group. One of the biggest lessons I learned was knowing when to step in and when to step back. Initially, I thought project management meant overseeing every step, but I quickly realized that trusting my team’s expertise was more effective. Instead of micromanaging, I facilitated discussions, created structure, and only intervened when necessary. </p>

				<p>We used Microsoft Teams as our main communication tool for quick updates and task tracking. Keeping an open space for team members to voice concerns helped keep everything on track without unnecessary intervention. My role was to ensure progress while allowing the team the space to execute their work effectively. </p>

				<h3>Data Architecture</h3>
				<p>Beyond project management, I also played a role in organizing and maintaining the project’s structure as a tertiary data architect. With multiple design and development files being shared across the team, maintaining organization and version control was critical to preventing confusion and keeping the workflow efficient. I established a clear file-naming system, ensured files were properly uploaded and accessible, and maintained version control so that the team always worked with the most updated versions. </p>

				<p>These details, while small, played a major role in streamlining collaboration and reducing the time spent searching for assets or resolving miscommunication. Keeping documentation up to date also prevented last-minute scrambling and ensured a smooth workflow from design to development. </p>

				<h3>UX Research &#38; User Testing</h3>
				<p>While user testing wasn’t originally part of my role, I took the initiative to organize testing sessions and track how real users interacted with the app. Since I was already overseeing project progress, it made sense to ensure our final product was truly optimized for students. Through testing, we identified friction points and areas that slowed down the ordering process. </p>

				<p>We simplified the checkout flow, adjusted button placements, and ensured clear navigation based on user feedback. These refinements helped shape a final product that was intuitive, functional, and free of unnecessary obstacles. Prioritizing user feedback throughout the process reinforced the importance of testing and iteration in creating a seamless experience. </p>

					<h2>Process</h2>

					<h3>Research &#38; Planning</h3>
					<p>Before development, we needed to transition our Figma prototype into a fully functional coded product while maintaining usability and efficiency. Our research phase focused on understanding student needs through a journey map and persona development, ensuring the app aligned with real user behavior.</p>
					<img src="images/User Persona.png">
					<img src="images/JourneyMap.png">
					<p>We used PHP, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build the web app, while Microsoft Teams served as our primary collaboration tool. A key challenge was balancing aesthetic design with functionality, ensuring the final product was both visually clear and intuitive.</p>

					<h3>Testing &#38; Iteration</h3>
					<p>To refine the user experience, we conducted three rounds of testing: Mid, Alpha, and Beta, each addressing different usability concerns. </p>

					<p>Mid-Testing focused on navigation flow, button placements, and ease of use. We streamlined the Figma prototype and evaluated what features were necessary versus unnecessary. This stage helped us establish a cleaner, more intuitive structure. </p>

					<p>Alpha Testing integrated feedback from Mid-Testing and emphasized checkout flow improvements and UI readability. We adjusted key UI elements based on user feedback, ensuring that the ordering process felt seamless. </p>

					<p>Beta Testing served as the final refinement phase, addressing performance improvements and accessibility enhancements. At this stage, microinteractions were fully integrated, making the experience more engaging and user-friendly. </p>

					<h3>Development &#38; Problem-Solving</h3>
					<p>Through testing, we identified key pain points and refined navigation, filtering, and the checkout experience for better usability. The checkout process was streamlined to minimize unnecessary steps, the filtering system was restructured for better visibility, and the overall interface was optimized to improve efficiency. </p>

					<p>Each stage of iteration brought us closer to a final product that was not only functional but also intuitive and enjoyable to use. </p>

					<h2>Solution</h2>
					<p>User testing and feedback led to key refinements that improved usability and efficiency throughout the app. One of the most significant changes was the checkout flow optimization, where we condensed the payment selection and order summary into a single, streamlined checkout page. This eliminated unnecessary steps and made the process faster and more intuitive. </p>
					<img class="solution-images" src="images/Checkout Before & After.png">

					<p>We also reworked the order confirmation experience by combining all relevant details into a single screen. Previously, users had to navigate between multiple pages to find their order number, pickup details, and tracking information. By consolidating these elements, we improved clarity and accessibility, ensuring that users could quickly reference their order briefly. </p>

					<p>Another major refinement was the filter and menu improvements. The original filtering system was visually overwhelming and difficult to navigate, making it harder for users to customize their orders. Users struggled to quickly find dietary preferences, allergens, and protein options due to a cluttered layout. To fix this, we redesigned the filter UI with a clearer structure, improving visibility and usability.</p>

					<p>The payment interface was redesigned to improve clarity and usability. The original layout made entering payment details more complicated than necessary, leading to a frustrating experience. To simplify this, we restructured the input fields, improved the hierarchy, and refined the overall layout to make interactions more intuitive. These adjustments made the checkout process feel faster and more user-friendly.</p>

				<h3>How Users Responded</h3>
				<p>User testing reinforced that these refinements made a real impact on usability. Participants responded positively to the streamlined checkout experience, improved payment flow, and more intuitive filtering system. The updated payment interface and consolidated order confirmation screen were frequently noted as key improvements that made ordering faster and easier. </p>

				<p>By focusing on real user pain points, we ensured that our final product was not just visually improved but meaningfully enhanced in functionality. The refinements made navigation more intuitive, reduced unnecessary steps, and created a more efficient ordering process.</p>
